# Attention-Map-Point-to-tell
An object detection system that detects the category and location of an object that is being pointed at by the user's hand, based on the attention map calculated from a image-classification neural network.

Main programs are under cnn/Guided-Attention-Inference-Network (based on code by github user @alokwhitewolf).
